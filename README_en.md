## Tech & Library

Below is the versions of the principal technologies and libraries used to make this project.

| 🚀   | Version |

| Node | 24.13.0 |
| pnpm | 10.28.1 |
| Nuxt | ^4.2.2  |
| Vue  | ^3.5.27 |

## Installation

To launch this project, you need to have Node 24 installed. You can download it at [Nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download). `pnpm` is also required, and can be activated using `corepack enable pnpm`.
Then, on the project root, install the dependencies by running `pnpm install`. For an overview of all of the available commands, please take a look inside the `package.json` file.

## Launching the project

### Development preview

`pnpm run dev [--host]` to launch the project in dev mode. The `--host` option allows for other devices on the same network to connect, to test natively on a mobile phone for example.

### Production

`pnpm run build` to build the project for production. Then you can preview the resulting build by running `pnpm run preview`.

## Docker image

It's also possible to put the web app in a Docker container. To do that, simply run `docker build -t address-search .`. After the build finishes, you can run the image by running `docker run -p 3000:3000 address-search`. The app will be accessible on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Tests

Running `pnpm test` will run every tests in the `test` folder, both `unit` and `nuxt` tests. Unit tests are designed to test outside functions, like the ones in the `utils` folder, whereas the `nuxt` tests are designed to test the components in a Nuxt environment.

If you want to run them separately, you can run the commands `pnpm run test:unit` and `pnpm run test:nuxt` respectively.

### Coverage

The coverage report is generated by running `pnpm run test:coverage`. It will generate a report in the `coverage` folder, which you can open in your browser to see the coverage of your tests.

## About AI usage

For this project, I used AI mainly to help for CSS related questions, generate the base of the tests, and some debugging.
Everything related to the project structure, components and app setup is my own making.
